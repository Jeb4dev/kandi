  abstract={DevSecOps, a combination of “Development,” “Security,” and “Operations,” integrates continuous security into software development lifecycles and is gaining traction. However, it faces challenges due to a lack of established success metrics. This can lead to increased costs, delayed feature releases, software quality issues, heightened cyberattack risks, and lower customer satisfaction. The purpose of the study is to define key DevSecOps metrics, outline its benefits, and highlight the positive business outcomes of its implementation. Utilizing the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework for its structured phases, the study employed a generic qualitative inquiry (GQI) approach. This involved reviewing 70 pieces of literature, 30 archived journals, and videos and conducting semi-structured interviews with 11 participants from large U.S. enterprises experienced in DevSecOps. The study leveraged the Purposive sampling for selecting participants, and the Variation, Specification, Abstraction, Internal Verification, External Verification, Demonstration, and Conclusion (VSAIEEDC) model was used for data analysis, addressing three research questions, and identifying themes, including coding processes. Tools like Quirkos 2.4® and Excel® assisted in visualizing data and theme identification through repeated words. The research revealed three key themes around defining success metrics, benefits, and areas for improvement. This study offers a detailed guide for organizations to integrate DevSecOps effectively, emphasizing continuous adaptation, innovative training, and a shift toward more secure, efficient, and collaborative development practices. These strategies are vital for maintaining competitiveness, operational excellence, and revenue growth in today's digital landscape. Future research can expand on these findings, exploring how resource-limited organizations can still effectively implement advanced security tools and technologies.},
